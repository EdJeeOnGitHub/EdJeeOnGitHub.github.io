I'm a graduate student in the [Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics](https://economics.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago.


My interests are in development economics and econometrics, with a particular focus on meta-evidence; adaptive trials; and synthesis of experimental and observational evidence. 

I also work as a graduate research assistant at the [Development Innovation Lab](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab/), typically providing support on projects involving [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).
